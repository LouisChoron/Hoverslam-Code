# Hoverslam-Code
An attempt to predict when to start a simulated SpaceX Falcon rocket landing burn in 1D, accounting for weight and drag, to allow for a safe touchdown.

This was a project I completed over the Summer of 2021 out of my own interest. The code is messy and imperfect, however I could successfully automate different rocket landing scenarios in 1D (different start heights, weights and velocities) and iterate the burn height until they all landed with approx. 0 m/s at approx 0 m. Ultimately, I created a graph of when to start burning for a successful landing, for a range of different scenarios. This is unfinished, however would give a good starting point/estimate for when to start the burn.
